1. N-Bodies simulation: Simulating n-bodies with both a naive and optimized method [03/2023]
  - Implemented brute-force solution
  - Implemented Barnes-Hut method in order to optimize code efficiency
  - Highlighting of the chaotic behaviour of the solutions

2. Predicting Stocks Behavior with an Agent Based Model (ABM) Model [05/2023]
*Team: [@marius-verdier](https://github.com/marius-verdier), [@edward-lucyszyn](https://github.com/edward-lucyszyn), Pierre Tesio, Mohamed Azahriou, Paul Bastin*
  - Computed the best coefficients to make the model fit real-world stock changes over the past 10 years.
  - Analyzed investment strategies employed over the past five decades.
  - Tested our model with recent data, achieving an accuracy rate of 60%.
  - Predicting Stocks Behavior: Agent Based Model Calibration
