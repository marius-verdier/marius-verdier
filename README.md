## üöÄ Projects

I present here some projects I worked on or I am working on, alone or with a team:

1. [N-Bodies simulation: Simulating n-bodies with both a naive and optimized method](https://github.com/marius-verdier/simulation-n-corps) [03/2023]
  - Implemented brute-force solution
  - Implemented Barnes-Hut method in order to optimize code efficiency
  - Highlighting of the chaotic behaviour of the solutions

2. [Predicting Stocks Behavior with an Agent Based Model (ABM)](https://github.com/marius-verdier/agent-based-model-calibration) [05/2023]

*Team: [@marius-verdier](https://github.com/marius-verdier), [@edward-lucyszyn](https://github.com/edward-lucyszyn), Pierre Tesio, Mohamed Azahriou, Paul Bastin*
  - Computed the best coefficients to make the model fit real-world stock changes over the past 10 years.
  - Analyzed investment strategies employed over the past five decades.
  - Tested our model with recent data, achieving an accuracy rate of 60%.
  - Predicting Stocks Behavior: Agent Based Model Calibration

3. [Denoiser model implementation in Swift](https://github.com/marius-verdier/swift_denoiser) [07/2024]
  - Naive implementation in Swift
  - Modifications to allow real-time use
